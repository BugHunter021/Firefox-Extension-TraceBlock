# How does it work?
The extension uses two different approaches to block tracker script. The first one is based on blocking requests/scripts loaded from a blacklist, this is the traditional approach adopted by most ad-blockers and other blockers. The other approach which makes TraceBlock more efficient against detecting potential trace activity user behaviour inside loaded scripts and kills them immediately. This makes the extension able to block inline scripts as well as tracer running through proxies.
